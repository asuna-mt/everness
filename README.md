# Everness Mapgen [everness]

Everness is a mapgen, which aims to provide an endless array of
beautiful biomes from the surface lands to the caverns with custom-painted
textures. It creates both a sense of discovery and of danger when one lands in the wrong biome.
It also adds structures, dungeons with loot chests, and custom skyboxes based on the biome.
